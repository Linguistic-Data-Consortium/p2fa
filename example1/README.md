Create a docker image with the aligner as available from Penn Phonetics

# Intro

This docker file uses python 2 and compiles HTK.  After unpacking the aligner
zip file, move the "model" directory and "align.py" to the current directory,
which will get copied into the image.  Checksums are included in separate
files to document exactly what was used.
