# p2fa

Code for working with the Penn Phonetics Lab Forced Aligner (p2fa)

# Dependencies

In general, these examples expect you to download and unpack libraries
yourself, and then run docker to build images with those libraries.

# Aligner

The examples assume you have the aligner from the Penn Phonetics Lab,
or some equivalent.  Specifically the "model" directory is expected.
Example 1 also expects the python code from that package, but the other
examples provide different python code.

# HTK

The examples assume an "htk" directory with version 3.4.1 of HTK.

# Docker

You should have some experience with docker.  Each example shows a basic
way of building and using an image.
